is included in this repository and at https://github.com/KrisJensen/EMpaper. The latter repository contains code relating to FAFB skeleton and synapse extraction, analysis, and plotting, and NEURON simulations. This repo contains code relating to:

- Plotting flies **Behavior** when central complex neurons are silenced using the temperature sensitive, synaptic vesicle reuptake inhibitor Shibire<sup>ts</sup>
- Plotting weight matrices for the FAFB **EM** dataset
- Analyzing and plotting calcium **Imaging** data
- Analyzing and plotting **RNA-Seq** data

The *FigureToCodeMap* contains a list of each data plot in the paper figures and the corresponding script used to analyze the data and generate the plot. Each of the directories also contains a further readme that explains how to obtain the necessary data and to run the code.
