# RNA-Seq Code Overview

All (processed) data is stored in the **data** directory. Raw data can be found at GEO: INSERT HERE. Differential gene expression statistics were calculated using R via the *Run_Bulk_Differential_Expression_bulk* notebook (for the bulk RNA sequencing data) or the *Run_Bulk_Differential_Expression_lowcell* notebook (for the low cell RNA sequencing data) and are stored in the **dge** directory. Plots were generated via Python with the *RNASeq_Clean* notebook and are stored in the **plots** directory
