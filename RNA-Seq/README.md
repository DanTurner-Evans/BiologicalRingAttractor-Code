# RNA-Seq Code Overview

All (processed) data is stored in the **data** directory. Raw data can be found at GEO: GSE155329. Differential gene expression statistics were calculated using R via the *RNASeq_Differential_Expression* notebook and are stored in the **dge** directory. Plots were generated via Python with the *RNASeq_plotting* notebook using the gene identities from the **geneIDs** directory and are stored in the **plots** directory
